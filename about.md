* Code development for mathematical problems.
* Development of paralell applications with OpenMp and MPI.
* Implementation of the software simulator and optimizator software as SaaS (Software as a Service).
* Administration of the Linux server where the gas simulator and optimizator software resides.

Previously I worked at the Galicia Supercomputing Centre in the e-Learning department, mostly in european e-Learning projects. I also did other kind of stuff, among them, for example:
