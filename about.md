I was born in [Rianxo](https://goo.gl/maps/yiDcWZsRNyv){:target="_blank"} (Galicia) in 1982. I have a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at the [University of Santiago de Compostela](http://www.usc.es){:target="_blank"}, and a Master Degree in High Performance Computing, also at this university.

Nowadays I am working at the Centro de Investigación en Tecnoloxías da Información [(CiTIUS)](http://citius.usc.es){:target="_blank"} as a researcher and Phd. student. My research is based in:

* Big Data applications performance with Hadoop and Spark.
* High Performance Computing applied to Natural Language Processing.
* Genomics alignment by using Big Data and HPC technologies.

Previously, at the Applied Mathematics Department, also at ther University of Santiago de Compostela, my duties were:

* Development of gas networks simulator and optimizator by using Fortran language.
* In charge of the development of a graphical interface for its use with the simulator and optimizator tool based in the open source project [Quantum Gis](http://www.qgis.org){:target="_blank"}. This interface is made with Pyhton and Qt (PyQt).
* Code development for mathematical problems.
* Development of paralell applications with OpenMp and MPI.
* Implementation of the software simulator and optimizator software as SaaS (Software as a Service).
* Administration of the Linux server where the gas simulator and optimizator software resides.

Previously I worked at the Galicia Supercomputing Centre in the e-Learning department, mostly in european e-Learning projects. I also did other kind of stuff, among them, for example:

* Linux servers administration (dom0 Xen servers and also virtual machines)
* Development of web platforms based on Java and Php
* Maintenance and development of an e-Learning platform based in the [Chamilo](https://chamilo.org/chamilo-lms/){:target="_blank"} Open Source platform, [Aula Cesga](https://aula.cesga.es){:target="_blank"}
* Managing videoconferences through BigBlueButton
* Scripts programming using Python and Bash
