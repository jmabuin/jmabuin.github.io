One of the state of the art tools to perform MSA is PASTA (Practical Alignments using SATé and TrAnsitivity). PASTA supports multithreading but it is limited to process datasets on shared memory systems. In this work we introduce PASTASpark, a tool that uses the Big Data engine Apache Spark to boost the performance of the alignment phase of PASTA, which is the most expensive task in terms of time consumption. Results: Speedups up to 10× with respect to single-threaded PASTA were observed, which allows to process an ultra-large dataset of 200,000 sequences within the 24-hr limit.Availability: PASTASpark is an Open Source tool available at https://github.com/citiususc/pastaspark","tags":["Big Data","Genomics","MSA","PASTA","HPC"],"title":"PASTASpark: multiple sequence alignment meets Big Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José M.

This fact has a huge impact on the DNA sequence alignment process, which nowadays requires the mapping of billions of small DNA sequences onto a reference genome. In this way, sequence alignment remains the most time-consuming stage in the sequence analysis workflow. To deal with this issue, state of the art aligners take advantage of parallelization strategies. However, the existent solutions show limited scalability and have a complex implementation. In this work we introduce SparkBWA, a new tool that exploits the capabilities of a big data technology as Spark to boost the performance of one of the most widely adopted aligner, the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA). The design of SparkBWA uses two independent software layers in such a way that no modifications to the original BWA source code are required, which assures its compatibility with any BWA version (future or legacy). SparkBWA is evaluated in different scenarios showing noticeable results in terms of performance and scalability. A comparison to other parallel BWA-based aligners validates the benefits of our approach. Finally, an intuitive and flexible API is provided to NGS professionals in order to facilitate the acceptance and adoption of the new tool. The source code of the software described in this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/citiususc/SparkBWA, with a GPL3 license.","tags":["Big Data","Genomics","Spark","BWA","Alignment","HPC"],"title":"SparkBWA: Speeding Up the Alignment of High-Throughput DNA Sequencing Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José M.

It is written in Java and most of the programs that run on Hadoop are also written in this language. Hadoop also provides an utility to execute applications written in other languages, known as Hadoop Streaming. However, the ease of use provided by Hadoop Streaming comes at the expense of a noticeable degradation in the performance.In this work, we introduce Perldoop, a new tool that au- tomatically translates Hadoop-ready Perl scripts into its Java counterparts, which can be directly executed on Hadoop while improving their performance significantly. We have tested our tool using several Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules, which consist of hundreds of regular expressions, but Perldoop could be used with any Perl code ready to be executed with Hadoop Streaming. Performance results show that Java codes generated using Perldoop execute up to 12x faster than the original Perl modules using Hadoop Streaming. In this way, the new NLP modules are able to process the whole Wikipedia in less than 2 hours using a Hadoop cluster with 64 nodes.","tags":["Big Data","Hadoop","NLP"],"title":"Perldoop: Efficient Execution of Perl Scripts on Hadoop Clusters","type":"publication"}]
